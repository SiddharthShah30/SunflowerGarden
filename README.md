# Happy Sunflower Day - Interactive Web Page

## Overview
This is an interactive HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project designed to celebrate "Happy Sunflower Day." The webpage features a heartwarming message and an animation that creates a sunflower garden when a button is clicked. At the end of the animation, a romantic message is displayed.

## Features
- Beautiful gradient background for a soft and elegant look.
- A quote section expressing love and admiration.
- A button to trigger an interactive sunflower-growing animation.
- Animated sunflowers that gradually appear across the screen.
- A final surprise message: "I love you ❤️."

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 for structuring the webpage.
- CSS3 for styling and animations.
- JavaScript for dynamic interactions and event handling.

## How It Works
1. The webpage initially displays a greeting message and a quote.
2. Clicking the "Let's grow a garden together" button triggers the animation.
3. The existing content fades out, and sunflowers begin to appear in a grid-like pattern across the screen.
4. After a short delay, a romantic message appears at the center of the screen.

## Installation & Usage
1. Download the `index.html` file and open it in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
2. No additional setup or dependencies are required.
3. Simply click the button to watch the animation unfold.

## Customization
- Modify the quote in the `.quote-container` div to personalize the message.
- Adjust the sunflower size and spacing in the JavaScript function `createSunflower()`.
- Change the final message by editing the text inside the `plantGarden()` function.
